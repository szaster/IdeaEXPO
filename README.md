# IdeaEXPO

## Live Site:

[IdeaEXPO](http://ideaexpo.herokuapp.com)


## Description

As an investor you have a platform where you can choose a business idea from different bloggers all over the world. As a business partner/collaborator you may join in on an idea or add on by reaching out to the blogger. Our app will be a playground for developing and discussing business ideas.

The user will be able to post, edit, and read business ideas and have the choice to make them public or private. Future investors or collaborators will be able to view publics posts and will be able to contact the blogger if they are interested in the business idea or would like to add on to the idea.

As a web dev camp graduate who needs an additional coding experience and a brilliant portfolio, you can find a team willing to collaborate on the applications of your interest with other web dev graduates to sharpen your skills, gain experience and maybe, launch a startup!!!
